## Opening the project

After downloading and installing IntelliJ Community, run the IntelliJ Community. In the first time you run it, you will be view a dialog like Figure 2. Click on the icon above "Open", then select the location where you stored the desklo project, then click "Ok" (see Figure 3).

Now you need to mark your "src" folder as a "Source Root" folder (Figure 4). You will only need to do this if your src folder in the project view is with color different than blue.

Then, click on the menu __Build__, then on __Build Module 'desklo'__ (or __Build Module 'desklo-main'__  depending how you downloaded the repository), like shown on Figure 5.

Finally, we need to run the Desklo. So, in the Project tab (on left), browse to the folder "src/com.cabanaban/desklo" right click on DeskloDesktop and then "run DeskloDesktop.main()", as Figure 7 shows.
